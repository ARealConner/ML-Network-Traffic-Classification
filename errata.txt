known issues when running main.py:
    + not all model classes are implemented yet 
    + UI not complete
        - add an escape (like 'q') to quit early
        - loop main so we can test more than one model/thing at a time

TODO's: 
    + complete UI in main.py
    + implement the SVM render
    + probably should only create one subfolder under the model folder with the 
    model name, in this folder there should be a trained model file, a results file,
    and a .png of the model render
        - this will require changes to Utilities.utilities get/set file locations
        - verify that we have covered all error checking necessary
        - name the model <model_name> + "_model.pkl"
    + add coefficient correlation script for selecting SVM columns
    + implement warm_start on models so we can do incremental training
        -can any of these models benefit from warm start?
        - if not, remove option to load a saved model when training
    + add error when trying to load the processed data file if it doesn't exist
    + note about joblib.dump: "Consider signing data with hmac if you need to ensure 
      that it has not been tampered with." This would be a good add in the future, in
      order to make it a legitimate sec product (if that is something ppl want to pursue)
