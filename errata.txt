known issues when running main.py:
    + not all model classes are implemented yet 
    + UI not complete
        - add an escape (like 'q') to quit early
        - loop main so we can test more than one model/thing at a time

TODO's: 
    + complete UI in main.py
    + implement the SVM render
    + probably should only create one subfolder under the model folder with the 
    model name, in this folder there should be a trained model file, a results file,
    and a .png of the model render
        - this will require changes to Utilities.utilities get/set file locations
        - verify that we have covered all error checking necessary
        - name the model <model_name> + "_model.pkl"
    + add coefficient correlation script for selecting SVM columns
    + implement warm_start on models so we can do incremental training
